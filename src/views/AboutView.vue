        I am a <strong>musician</strong> turned
        <strong>programmer</strong> turned
        <strong>interactive media designer.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a great interest in the intersections of Art, Design, Science and
        Technology. I seek to understand how technical systems can be designed
        to enable the creation of beautiful experiences with an empowering sense
        of utilty and possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have created <strong>games</strong>, <strong>websites</strong>,
        <strong>applications</strong>,
        <strong>and a variety of interactive experiences, including work in
          AR/VR.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I also have a passion for teaching and mentoring and have designed and
        taught a course on digital art.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some things I really like to nerd out on include trivia, comedy, jazz,
        cooking and gaming.
